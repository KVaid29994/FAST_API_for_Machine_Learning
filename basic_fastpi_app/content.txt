🌀 Understanding `async` and `await` in Python

`async` and `await` are Python keywords used to **write asynchronous code** — code that can handle
 multiple operations **without waiting** for each to complete before starting the next.

### 🔁 Why Use Async?

In traditional (synchronous) code, Python **waits** for each line to finish before moving on.  
This is inefficient for I/O-bound tasks like:
- Reading from files
- Calling APIs
- Accessing databases


✅ With `async`/`await`, Python can **pause** waiting tasks and do something else in the meantime — 
improving speed and scalability.

### 🧠 Basic Concepts

- `async def`: Defines an **asynchronous function**
- `await`: Pauses execution until the awaited task completes
- `asyncio`: The built-in Python library for running asynchronous tasks
