What is an API?
An API (Application Programming Interface) allows two applications to communicate with each other â€” for example, sending input to a machine learning model and receiving predictions in return.

Why FastAPI?

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) Python web framework for building APIs.

It's easy to use, with automatic validation and interactive Swagger docs.

Ideal for deploying ML models as RESTful endpoints.

Async support makes it scalable for production environments.
