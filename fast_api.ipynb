    "### üîÑ **Tight Coupling**  \n",

    "\n",
    "### üß© **Limited Reusability**  \n",
    "Functionality couldn‚Äôt be reused across projects easily. Everything had to be **rewritten or copied**, increasing code duplication and maintenance effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üêå **Scalability Issues**  \n",
    "You had to scale the **entire application** even if only one module (e.g., user login) needed more resources ‚Äî this led to **inefficient resource usage**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚è≥ **Slow Development & Deployment**  \n",
    "Since all teams worked on a single codebase, development was **slower**, testing was **heavier**, and deployment cycles were **long and risky**.\n",
